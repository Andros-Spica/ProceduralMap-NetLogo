# ProceduralMap-NetLogo
Procedural generation of maps (terrain, climate, biomes) using [NetLogo](https://ccl.northwestern.edu/netlogo/).
<PENDING TO DEVELOP INFO>

## Terrain

**terrainGenerator_v01_simple**: the initial, quite simple approach.

**terrainGenerator_v1_twoAlgorithms**: this version presents two cleaner and more complete algorithms. NetLogo-style uses patch and turtle calls while C#-style is my attempt of a more lower-level object-based language). I refer to C# because I was actually prototyping these algorithms to use them in [Unity](https://unity3d.com).

**terrainGenerator_v2_withRivers**: this version creates rivers over the terrain generated by v1 algorithms and derives the soil moisture of patches from rivers and meters below sea level. Rivers are formed by one or more streams which start at random patches and move from patch to patch towards the least elevation. There are two algorithms implementing the movement of streams: choosing only among neighbors (`river-algorithm = "least neighbor"`), favouring connections between basins, or neighbors *AND* the patch considered (`river-algorithm = "absolute downhill"`), producing 'stump' rivers more often. Every time a stream is formed, the elevation of the patches involved is depressed by a quantity (`par_waterDepression`) and then smoothed, together with that of neighboring patches. A passing stream will add 1 unit of `water` to a patch while patches below sea level have `water` units proportional to their depth. The amount of `water` of patches is converted to units of `moisture` and then moisture is distributed to other 'dry' patches using NetLogo's primitive `diffuse` (NOTE: not ideal because it does not account for the difference in elevation).

## Climate
**terrainGenerator-withClimate_v01**: using the C#-style terrain, this is an initial approach to defining patch temperatures and wind directions to be integrated into a climate simulation. Temperature is dependent only on latitude, elevation, and slope (both elevation and slope are average values for a given patch). Wind direction is dependent on latitude (latitude regions are defined according to Coriolis effect). Still no atmoshperic dynamics in this version.
